\section{Linear dynamical systems}
\subsection{Linear dynamical systems}
$x_{t+1} = A_tx_t$ , t = 1,2,. . .\\
\textbullet $A_t$ are n × n dynamics matrices
\textbullet $(A_t)_{ij}(x_t)_j$
is contribution to $(x_{t+1})_i$
from $(x_t)_j$\\
\textbullet system is called time-invariant if $A_t = A$ doesn't depend on time\\
\textbullet can simulate evolution of xt using recursion $x_{t+1} = A_tx$\\
\textbullet linear dynamical system with input\\
$x_{t+1} = A_tx_t + B_tu_t + c_t$, t = 1,2,...\\
\thickspace -- $u_t$ is an input m-vector\\
\thickspace -- $B_t$ is n × m input matrix\\
\thickspace -- $c_t$ is offset\\
\textbf{K-Markov model}:\\
$x_{t+1} = A_1x_t + ... + A_Kx_{t-K+1}$, t = K,K + 1,...\\
\thickspace -- next state depends on current state and K - 1 previous states\\
\thickspace – also known as auto-regresssive model\\
\thickspace – for K = 1, this is the standard linear dynamical system $x_{t+1} = Ax_t$\\
\subsection{Population dynamics}
\textbullet $x_t \in R^{100}$ gives population distribution in year t = 1,...,T\\
\textbullet $(x_t)^i$ is the number of people with age i - 1 in year t (say, on January 1)\\
\textbullet birth rate $b \in R^{100}$, death (or mortality) rate $d \in R^{100}$\\
\textbullet $b_i$ is the number of births per person with age i - 1\\
\textbullet $d_i$ is the portion of those aged i - 1 who will die this year (we’ll take $d_{100} = 1$)
\textbullet let’s find next year’s population distribution $x_t+1$ (ignoring immigration)\\
\textbullet number of 0-year-olds next year is total births this year:\\
$(x_{t+1})_1 = b^Tx_t$\\
\textbullet number of i-year-olds next year is number of (i - 1)-year-olds this year, minus those who die:
$(x_{t+1})_{i+1} = (1 - d_i)(x_t)_i$ , i = 1,..,99\\
\textbullet $x_{t+1} = Ax_t$ , where\\
$A =
\begin{bmatrix}
    b_1 & b_2 &...& b_{99} & {b_{100}} \\
    1-d_1 & 0 &...& 0 & 0\\
    0 & 1-d_2 &...& 0 & 0\\
    . & . &...& . &.\\
    . & . &...& . &.\\
    0 & 0 &...& 1-d_{99} & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$
\subsection{Epidemic dynamics}
\textbf{SIR Model}\\
\textbullet 4-vector $x_t$ gives proportion of population in 4 infection states\\
-- \textit{Susceptible}: can acquire the disease the next day\\
-- \textit{Infected}: have the disease
-- \textit{Recovered}: had the disease, recovered, now immune\\
-- \textit{Deceased}: had the disease, and unfortunately died\\
\textbullet sometimes called SIR model\\
\textbullet e.g., $x_t = (0.75,0.10,0.10,0.05)$
\textbf{over each day},\\
\textbullet among susceptible population,\\
-- 5\% acquires the disease\\
-- 95\% remain susceptible
\textbullet among infected population,\\
-- 1\% dies\\
-- 10\% recovers with immunity\\
-- 4\% recover without immunity (i.e., become susceptible)\\
-- 85\% remain infected\\
\textbullet 100\% of immune and dead people remain in their state\\
\textbullet epidemic dynamics as linear dynamical system\\

    0 & 0.10 & 1 & 0\\
